# Bitcoin Cash Satoshi's Vision (SV)

Four fundamental pillars form the basis of Bitcoin SV's roadmap 
to create the one blockchain for the world: 
stability, scalability, security, and safe instant transactions (a.k.a 0-confirmation).

> "The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. 
> Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. 
> It never really hits a scale ceiling."

## 1 - Stability

Businesses, especially the biggest enterprises, require stability before they 
will operate on a technology platform. Repeated, unnecessary, and unproven changes 
to the Bitcoin protocol can be detrimental to the economic incentive structure 
and security of the blockchain. They can also cause significant uncertainties 
for large scale businesses that need to plan years in advance and commit 
significant resources before deciding to build applications and projects on Bitcoin Cash.

The Bitcoin SV vision is to provide assured stability with only a limited 
and well known set of changes planned to restore the Bitcoin protocol to its original design, 
and enable innovation to occur on top of a stable base protocol.

Part of this is restoring the Satoshi op_codes to enable businesses 
and development teams around the world to create the many solutions 
possible on the BSV blockchain, such as smart contracts, tokenisation, 
atomic swaps, and many more.

## 2 – Scalability

In order for Bitcoin SV to truly act as a global money platform, 
it is necessary to demonstrate that the platform is ready to process transaction 
volume at the required scale. The Bitcoin SV roadmap is primarily focussed 
on delivering capacity increases, through bigger default or miner configurable 
block sizes and performance improvements. Out of the nine test environments 
in use by the project, the SV Gigablock Testnet (SV-GBTN) is specifically dedicated 
to identifying bottlenecks and performance measurement of proposed changes. 
The SV-GBTN is running on a continuous cycle of performance tests and the 
results of those are for public consumption so that miners and other industry 
participants will be able to make informed scaling decisions.

By enabling massive scaling, Bitcoin SV will pave the way for the BSV blockchain 
to support significantly higher transaction volumes and more transaction fees for miners. 
This is important for miners to maintain profitability as the block reward 
will halve again in the year 2020 (reducing from 12 BSV to 6.25 BSV for each block), 
and halve again in later years.

Massive scaling is also important to convince enterprises to use BSV for their 
blockchain applications - which will require big blocks and large throughput capacity.


## 3 - Security

Bitcoin SV will be a global currency. To enable such a future, we need to be 
prepared to ensure a level of security commensurate with a global money system. 
To do this, the Bitcoin SV project has focused on rigorous Quality Assurance 
for mining node software.

This is achieved by implementing a rigid set of test phases with full traceability 
throughout the test pipeline, to assure users that changes pass through a formal 
and rigorous validation process before they are accepted. In this respect, 
Bitcoin SV aspires to levels of Quality Assurance exemplified by mission critical 
industries such as aerospace, medicine and national security.

First, the team will use best practice change management processes 
and engage external QA expertise from other security-sensitive industries 
to monitor and audit its QA processes.

Second, the project will engage the services of an industry-leading blockchain 
security audit firm.

Third, the project will offer a lucrative bug bounty program matching 
the likes of Google and Microsoft to motivate and mobilize security researchers 
around the world to find and responsibly report security vulnerabilities. 
The team has engaged expert service providers in the field to develop 
an industry best practice "Responsible Disclosure Program."

## 4 – Safe instant transactions (a.k.a. 0-conf)

Instant transactions are key to unlocking the brick and mortar merchant market 
for Bitcoin SV payments. Security improvements can be made to better secure instant transactions 
for the future, and the Bitcoin SV roadmap treats safe instant transactions as a key priority.
