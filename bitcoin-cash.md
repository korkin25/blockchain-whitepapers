# Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin
as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". 
Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. 
The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, 
permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.

All Bitcoin holders as of block #478 558 are also owners of Bitcoin Cash. 
All are welcome to join the Bitcoin Cash community 
as we move forward in creating sound money accessible to the whole world.


## Bitcoin Cash Whitepaper

The original whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, 
the anonymous creator of the worlds first cryptocurrency. 
The title of the Bitcoin whitepaper is 
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". 
Bitcoin Cash aims to continue this vision of bringing sound money to the world.

## Bitcoin Cash Roadmap 

To become a solid base for application development and innovation, 
Bitcoin Cash must continuously improve and compete. 
Working together, we can build a technical foundation 
to empower Bitcoin Cash to be the best money the world has ever seen.

# Bitcoin Cash Roadmap

The goal for Bitcoin Cash is to become sound money that is usable by everyone in the world. 
This is a civilization-changing technology which will dramatically increase human freedom 
and prosperity.

This roadmap is intended to provide high-level technical direction, 
and enable different technical teams to work together towards a common goal 
for advancing Bitcoin Cash. The role of developers in furthering this goal 
is to produce high-quality professional software that serves the needs of its users, 
miners and merchants. We strive for continuous technical improvement, 
to produce reliable products providing a solid foundation for Bitcoin Cash.

The basic design of Bitcoin Cash is sound. However, this does not mean it is perfect. 
It is prudent to make incremental improvements to the system with technically 
sound design and careful engineering. By implementing optimizations and protocol upgrades, 
peer-to-peer digital cash will scale many orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

The needed technical improvements can be divided into three categories:

1. Enable Bitcoin Cash to scale from ~100 Tx/s to over 5,000,000 Tx/s. 
   Protocol improvements must be made so that mass-parallelization can enable this level 
   of transaction processing.

2. Improving the payment experience to ensure that it is instant and reliable. 
   Transactions should be secure within three seconds.

3. Make Bitcoin Cash extensible. An extensible protocol makes future improvements 
   less disruptive, and provides a solid base for businesses and developers to build on.

To become a solid base for application development and innovation, 
Bitcoin Cash must continuously improve and compete. 
Working together, we can build a technical foundation to empower Bitcoin Cash 
to be the best money the world has ever seen.


## Appendix - Roadmap

**Scaling**

- [Complete] - Canonical Transaction Ordering (scalable block processing)
- [Under Way] - Faster Block Propagation (graphene or other)
