**Q: What's an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) / Token Sales?**

Read the free excerpt titled [ICOs: Magic Beans and Bubble Machines](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/icos-magic-beans-and-bubble-machines/) from the book [Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/book/) by David Gerard.

> Token offerings have been around a while, but kicked off enormously in the second bubble. 
> The usual pretext is crowdfunding, but in practice the tokens are just traded on the exchanges as commodities. 
> The creators then cash in. The value proposition for buyers is, as for the creators, easy money in a bubble.
